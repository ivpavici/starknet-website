    body: StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as
      a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any
      dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation –  without
      compromising Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to StarkNet’s
      reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system
      – [STARK](https://starkware.co/stark/). StarkNet Contracts and the
      StarkNet OS are written in Cairo – supporting the deployment and scaling
      of any use case, whatever the business logic. Your use of the StarkNet
      Alpha is under [these](https://starknet.io/starknet-terms-of-use/) terms
      of use.
