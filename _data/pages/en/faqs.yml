        label: What will the StarkNet tokens be used for?
        body: The StarkNet token will be used as a staking token for participation in
          StarkNet’s consensus mechanisms, as a Governance token, and for paying
          transaction fees. The rationale for each of these utilities is
          presented in our [decentralization
          proposal](https://medium.com/@starkware/part-2-a-decentralization-and-governance-proposal-for-starknet-23e335645778),
          in the section titled  “What will the tokens be used for?”

        body: SHARP (shared prover) is a service that allows proving the execution
          of **several** Cairo programs in **the same proof**. The Cairo program
          enforcing the validity of Starknet’s state transition, the StarkNet
          OS, can make use of SHARP. Namely, proving StarkNet’s state transition
          can be done together with a bunch of programs that are unrelated to
          StarkNet, lowering the marginal cost of each participant. Whether or
          not it is worthwhile for StarkNet to use SHARP or have a dedicated
          prover depends on several parameters, most prominently the TPS
          (transactions per second). Large executions might not benefit too much
          by sharing the proof with much smaller programs.
        label: How is StarkNet Related to SHARP?
